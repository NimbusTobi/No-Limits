	      <p>One reason I love martial arts is because it forces me to make tough decisions. In the cage, every move I make is a small choice that can render me victorious or supine on the canvas. Putting myself in these circumstances, though, has forced me to become assertive, mentally sharp, and in charge of myself.<br></br><br></br>Similarly, I’m a fan of the chaos that nature brings. During a hike or a camping session, a number of things can go wrong—the sky can open up and rain all over you, your shelter could be destroyed, food and water could be ruin.<br></br><br></br>All of that stuff sucks, but it’s when you embrace the suck and are forced to push through it that you live in the moment. That’s when you can start to break free of your daily stressors, like technology and work woes, and truly start to think about what matters in your life.<br></br><br></br>Think about this; One-fifth. That’s the fraction of Americans who feel anxious and stressed, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. In 2018, 40% of Americans reported being more stressed than they were the year before, and when asked what caused this feeling of unrest, “My health” was one of the top answers.<br></br><br></br>If that’s the case, then the problem isn’t going away anytime soon. Nowadays, people are slouched over in their chairs with their eyes glued to a screen for 8 to 10 hours a day. Texts make us anxious, work emails stress us out. On top of that, we’re lazier than ever, and as a result, over 160 million Americans are either overweight or obese.<br></br><br></br>There’s no miracle cure for any of these problems, but as an Eagle Scout I believe firmly that the outdoors can aid your physical and mental well being. Yes, it is that simple. If this sounds like a load of Kabuki, it’s not. Research that looked at over 140 studies and 290 million people found that exposure to green space, and the outside, reduces the risk of type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, even premature death.<br></br><br></br>For example</p>
	      <ul>
	      	<li> Are you working because you love it or for a paycheck?</li>
	      	<li>Is the relationship you’ve been in for years on the rise or actually stagnant?</li>
	      	<li>And do you really not have time to hit the gym or are you just a master procrastinator?</li>
	      </ul>
	      <p>The no limits system isnt an end, but a means to a more enlightened and greater future. So, what are you waiting for? Take your first steps towards self-awareness and begin your journey towards your true potential.</p>
